# 3300_Lab0

In this lab we learned to create a simple 1 bit 2 by 1 multiplexer, and from that implement this multiplexer to simulate 3 bit **2 by 1** and **4 by 1** multiplexers. 

In these file the simple 1 bit *2 by 1 mux* is shown in the file labeled
>mux_2x1

The 3 bit *2 by 1 mux* is shown in the file labeled
>mux_2x1_3bit

And the 3 bit *4 by 1 mux* is shown in the file labeled
>mux_4x1_3bit
